                <p>A function generator is usually a piece of electronic test equipment or software used to generate different types of electrical waveforms over a wide range of frequencies. Some of the most common waveforms produced by the function generator are the sine wave, square wave, triangular wave and sawtooth shapes. These waveforms can be either repetitive or single-shot (which requires an internal or external trigger source).Integrated circuits used to generate waveforms may also be described as function generator ICs.</p>

                <h2>Designing an Intelligent Traffic Signal</h2>

                <span>Digital Logic</span>
                <p>The target of the project is to build an intelligent traffic signal for a four-way intersection. Such a system will help reduce traffic congestion in busy areas and enhance public transport efficiency. It will achieve such a feat by scaling the waiting times at each signal with their respective traffic load. The intuition behind our intelligent traffic signal design is based on using a 2-bit
                    counter that loops around 0 to 3 (road 0, road 1, road 2, road 3 and reset through
                    a 4 state catcher) to cycle around the four roads, one by one. The 2-bit counter is
                    operated by a 0.2 Hz clock, meaning it will increment after every 5 seconds. In
                    other words, during the cycling process, it will stay on each road for 5 seconds
                    before moving to the next. The output of the counter will be fed into a 2-to-4
                    decoder to extract the four minterms.</p>

                <p id="para">Smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives and thus, need to be functional all
                    the time. However, like most portable devices, smartphones are battery-powered. This means
                    that they must be recharged. The conventional way of charging a smartphone would be to use the
                    traditional wired chargers. Wired chargers can be a nuisance, since you not only have to carry
                    them everywhere but also look for one that matches the USB port on your smartphone. A simple
                    solution to this problem would be to remove the need for wires by making use of the concept of
                    wireless charging. Therefore, we decided to create a wireless charger capable of charging a
                    smartphone.</p>

                <span class="dashboard">Dashboard</span>
                <p id="para">Scientists believe that once the first settlement is built in space, and a mining, refining, manufacturing, and transportation infrastructure is established, economics and ingenuity will enable large settlements to be built in fewer than 15 years. This is akin to a “Southern California freeway phenomenon”, wherein a new freeway is built into a remote area with very little population, and in just a few years the freeway is clogged with traffic because the access it provides enables communities and businesses to be established on its flanks. Having infrastructure in place makes it easier to get more infrastructure in place.</p>
